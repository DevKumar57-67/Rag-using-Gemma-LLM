In the init function of this class, we ingest the data from the dataset in the vector database. This class have as well a query member function. In this function we first perform similarity search with the query to the vector database. Then, we call the generate function of the ai agent object. Before returning the answer, we use a predefined template to compose the overal response from the question, answer and the context retrieved.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Packages instalation and

It is often used in statistics, probability theory, and machine learning to model continuous data.\n\nThe normal distribution is important because it has a number of properties that make it a useful tool for modeling real-world data. These properties include:\n\n* The mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution are the same for any set of data. This means that the mean and standard deviation can be used to represent the entire distribution of data.\n* The normal distribution is symmetric, meaning that it is symmetrical about its mean. This means that the probability density is the same on both sides of the mean.\n* The normal distribution is bell-shaped, meaning that it is symmetric about its mean. This means that the probability density is higher in the center of the distribution and lower on the sides.\n\nThese properties make the normal distribution a useful tool for modeling real-world data.

Plot a histogram out of the sampled data. If you can fit the bell-shaped \"normal\" curve to the histogram, then the hypothesis that the underlying random variable follows the normal distribution can not be rejected.\\n2. Check Skewness and Kurtosis of the sampled data. Skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3 are typical for a normal distribution, so the farther away they are from these values, the more non-normal the distribution.\\n3. Use Kolmogorov-Smirnov or/and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality.

Here's a breakdown of bias and variance:\n\n**Bias:** Bias is the difference between the predicted value and the actual/true value. It can be interpreted as the distance from the average prediction and true value.\n\n**Variance:** Variance is a measure of how much the predicted value varies from one sample to another. It can be interpreted as the average of the squared differences between the predicted value and the actual/true value.\n\nThe bias-variance trade-off is a trade-off between bias and variance. The goal of any machine learning algorithm is to achieve a good balance between bias and variance. A low bias means that the model is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data. A high bias means that the model is too complex and overfits the data. A high variance means that the model is more sensitive to noise in the data. A low variance means that the model is very robust and does not change much with noise in the data.\n\n**<font color='green'>Context:</font>**\n[Document(page_content='question: What’s the interpretation of the bias term in linear models? \\u200d⭐️\\nanswer: Bias is simply, a difference between predicted value and actual/true value.
